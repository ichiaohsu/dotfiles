## VIA configurations

The files here are the backups for the customized keyboard layout files, which consumed by the open-source configurator project [VIA](https://github.com/the-via/releases/releases).

The naming convention is currently in `(brand)_(model)_(layout).json` syle. For example, the filename `bioi_g60ble_HHKB` is the HHKB layout for g60ble by bioi.
